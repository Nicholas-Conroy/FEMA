TODOs

- order missing persons table by the person seen least recently (Completed: includes/data.php - line 29)
- popup on (normal user) page when community center is low on certain items
- login system with different pages depending on login type (FEMA, community center, normal user)
- styling (do later once overall structure of content is in place)
- alert/popup representing trucks being "notified" when FEMA needs are mat
- on FEMA page, ability to remove missing persons from list (simply, like just clicking a button or a box next to the name)
    - on everyone else's page, alert when a person has been found 

- rewrite/restructure code as necessary for improved readability and layout
    - use "empty" function instead of current setup for checking if data is empty?

- don't allow manual access to home.php without logging in

- you can submit empty forms which doesn't really matter but still, maybe should have a warning (do PHP fix, maybe using functions from a file)
- each community center has a different login and can only donate from themselves (mostly for materials to give to FEMA form)
