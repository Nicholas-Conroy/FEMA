TODOs

- popup on (normal user) page when community center is low on certain items
- login system with different pages depending on login type (FEMA, community center, normal user)
- alert/popup representing trucks being "notified" when FEMA needs are mat
- on everyone else's page, alert when a person has been found 

- rewrite/restructure code as necessary for improved readability and layout
    - use "empty" function instead of current setup for checking if data is empty?
    - refactoring code to make more efficient (JS, CSS, etc)    

- don't allow manual access to home.php without logging in

- you can submit empty forms which doesn't really matter but still, maybe should have a warning (do PHP fix, maybe using functions from a file)
    - changing quantity to 0 doesn't avoid "fill out form properly" error, you can't undo it
- each community center has a different login and can only donate from themselves (mostly for materials to give to FEMA form)


- notify user when things are successfully updated (through forms)
